Analyzing Airplane Crashes since 1908

The following code analysis the variations and trends in airplane crashes since 1908. 
Due to poor data recording capacibilties, it is diffciult to assess changes in the past. However, starting 1930's there has been a significant advancement in data recording capabilities in the aviation industry. 

The figures respond to: 
  1. Number of Fatalities per Year
  2. Log(Number of fatalities) per Year
  3. Probability of Death in case of crash 
  4. Top 20 Fatal aircraft types 
  

The number of fatalities has decreased over time. There are sudden spikes in the data which correspond to terrorist related activites like hijacking. 

The log graph helps remove skewness from the data. 

The avearge probability of death in case of crash was initially 1 and over a period has decreased to less than 7. Even with increased number of flights, a decrease in probability corresponds to the fact of increased safety measures adopted by the industry. 

The last bar graph shows the top 20 fatal aircrafts(terms of number of fatalities) in the industry. This data can be normalized by the number of flights.
